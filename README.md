### ⚖️ Ethical Design Statement

This tool was created to promote **non-destructive, reversible file handling** in local development environments.

If you fork, modify, or redistribute it, please preserve the original intent:

- Empower users to **review** before they remove
- Allow **full reintegration** of files and folders
- Avoid destructive defaults or automated deletion

This is a system built for trust and transparency.  
Let it serve as a safe utility — not a silent eraser.

I needed to sanitize my files before upload, and I am not a coder... so... I decided to code my own sanitizer. then i checked its functionality against canon process. and I like mine better. So, I am uploading to share. I am not responsible for how you use this. I am only offering what tools I am building and using as I need them.
